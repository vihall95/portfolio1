## Portfolio of an Aspiring Data Scientist



# [Project One : Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification.] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Convolutional%20Networks%20for%20Image%20Classification)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/convnetworks.jpg)

This project sets out to use the Keras deep learning library to implement and test different image classification tasks. Networks were test on two different
datasets including MNIST and CIFAR10 data, both of which can be accessed through the Keras dataset library. 



# [Project Two: Customer Churn Reduction] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Customer%20Churn%20Reduction)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/CustomerChurn.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to utilize different machine learning techniques to create a tool that a company can use to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. By providing these predictions any number of business stakeholders like, a marketing or merchant team, can produce strategies to intervene and try to prevent churn. Multiple classification models were tested before the final results was chosen.

## Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression - Baseline linear classifier for binary data
- Random Forest - Ensemble Bagging Classifier (Bootstrap Aggregation). Makes predictions by combining classifiers on bootstrapped subsets.
- K-Nearest Neighbors - Instance Based Classifier. Makes predictions based on the training set only by searching for the most similar instances
- Support Vector Machine - Maximal Margin Classifier. Finds the hyperplane that splits the data into two groups, and chooses the the hyperplane that maximizes the margin (distance between hyperplane and close points)
- XGBoost - Ensemble Boosting Classifier. Type of gradient boosting. Trains many models in a gradual additive manner and identifies shortcomings with a loss function.
- Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLP Classifer). Relies on an underlying neural network



# [Project Three: Customer Personality Analysis] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Customer%20Personality%20Analysis)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/customerpersonalityanalysis.jpg)

This project uses unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to improve the results of targeted advertising. the data came from a Kaggle challenge. After initial data cleansing and EDA, KMean Clustering is used to identify latent groupings and then those results were used as an additional feature for Logistic Regression



# [Project Four: Data Storage Management with Python and Parquet] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Data%20Storage%20Management%20using%20Python%20and%20Parquet)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/datastoragemanagement.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate different creation and retrieval strategies for accessing airline data stored in Parquet file formats.
This dataset contains flight route information from OpenFlights. The original data in stored as JSONL in zip file. The JSON data is parsed, converted to Parquet and saved folders created by key. Then different retrieval techniques are employed to access the Parquet files is a digestible form.



# [Project Five: Data Visualization Techniques] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Data%20Visualization%20Techniques)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/DataVisualizationTechniques.png)

This project seeks to understand and evaluate different data visualization techniques in Python, R, and Tableau



## [Project Six: Footwear Pricing Predictions] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Footwear%20Pricing%20Predictions)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/footwearpricing.jpg)

The purpose of this project was to try and accurately predict the price of shoes based on several explanatory variables.  Extensive Data Cleansing and EDA were performed on a dataset of 10,000 women's shoes. A regression model was used to try and predict the price.



# [Project Seven: Movie Review Sentiment Modeling] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Movie%20Review%20Processing%20and%20Modeling)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/moviereview.jpg)

This project uses movies reviews to identify a model that best classifies the sentiment of the review. Includes data prep of text including tokenizing, stemming, and tf-idf vextorization. Both logistic and SVM models were tested.



# [Project Eight: Retail Price Classification] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Retail%20Price%20Classification)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/retailpriceclassification.jpg)

The purpose of this project was to use a series of features about mobile phones to help determine what price range a phone should be in for a fledgling business. The data, which came from Kaggle.com, was cleaned and prepped, then used to test two main classifier modeling techniques wherein numerous parameters were examined. Two modeling methods, Random Forest and XGBoost were tested with with multiple parameter values until the best accuracy was acheived.



# [Project Nine: Retail Sales Forecasting] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Retail%20Sales%20Forecasting)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/retailsalesforecasting.jpg)

The purpose of this project was to find the best modeling technique to predict sales for a chain of retail stores. The data, which came from Kaggle.com
was cleaned and prepped,then used to test a series of time series modeling techniques including SARIMA and SARIMAX.



# [Project Ten: Generative Modeling on MNIST data: Variational Autoencoders (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/tree/main/Variational%20Autoencoder%20with%20MNIST%20Data)
![] (https://github.com/vihall95/portfolio1/blob/main/website%20images/mnist.jpg)

This project implements a Variational Autencoder trained on MNIST data to generate images.
